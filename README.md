### What is "WinJPLib"?
This software allows your computer to retrieve (Get) JP-8000 sounds (Performances and Patches), as well as RPS Pattern data and Motion Control data used to automatically carry out sound changes. Furthermore, since you can use your computer to rearrange and rename data loaded from the JP-8000, editing is a snap. You can save edited data to disk or other media, making it possible for you to handle enormous numbers of sounds. Then, when you need to, you can load (Send) the saved data back into the JP-8000.

#### With this software, you can:
1. Get data (from the JP-8000 into your personal computer) and Send data (from your computer to the JP-8000)
2. Edit the arrangement and names of data
3. Preview Patches and Performances (for checking the sound)

#### However, the software does not allow you to:
1. Change individual data parameters
2. Limit the amount of data with Get and Send
3. Get and Send SMF data
